This demo shows how easy it is to create beautiful sliding and 3D effects using Flutter's [`AnimatedContainer`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedContainer-class.html)
class and it's [`transform`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedContainer/transform.html) property.

For this demo we had to create our own visual touch response class, similar to React Native's [TouchableOpacity](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/touchableopacity). We will be creating a flutter library out of it very soon, but for now you can simply copy and paste it from `components/tap_opacity.dart` file.

## Running the demo

- [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Open [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Build and run the app on an emulator or a real device
